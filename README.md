This is a bare-bones example of a Sinatra application providing a REST
API to a DataMapper-backed model.
This Application lets a User reserve a book, movie or a periodical from the Website. The UI is connected to a Springboot backend and MySql database.

The entire application is contained within the `LibraryCapstone` folder with the UI and backend in separate folders. Every

`config.ru` is a minimal Rack configuration for unicorn.

`run-tests.sh` runs a simplistic test and generates the API
documentation below.

It uses `run-curl-tests.rb` which runs each command defined in
`commands.yml`.

## Install

    bundle install

## Run the app

    unicorn -p 7000

## Run the tests

    ./run-tests.sh
