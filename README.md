# REST API example application

This is a bare-bones example of a Sinatra application providing a REST
API to a DataMapper-backed model.

The entire application is contained within the `app.rb` file.

`config.ru` is a minimal Rack configuration for unicorn.

`run-tests.sh` runs a simplistic test and generates the API
documentation below.

It uses `run-curl-tests.rb` which runs each command defined in
`commands.yml`.

## Install

    bundle install

## Run the app

    unicorn -p 7000

## Run the tests

    ./run-tests.sh

# REST API

The REST API to the example app is described below.
